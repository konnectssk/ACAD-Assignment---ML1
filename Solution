# 1. What are the three stages to build the hypotheses or model in machine learning?
    
    Stage 1: Model building
    Stage 2: Model testing
    Stage 3: Applying the model

# 2. What is the standard approach to supervised learning?

    The standard approach to supervised learning is to split the set of example into the training set and the test set.

# 3. What is Training set and Test set?
    Training set: 
    In Machine Learning, a training set is a dataset used to train a model. In training the model, specific
    features are picked out from the training set. These features are then incorporated into the model.
    thereby, if the training set is labeled correctly, the model should be able to learn something from
    these features.
    In other words, the set of data which is used to discover the potentially predictive relationship is known as ‘Training Set’. 
    The Training set is an examples given to the learner, 
    
    Test Set:
    The test set is a dataset used to measure how well the model performs at making predictions on that test set. 
    If the prediction scores for the test set are unreasonable, we’ll have to make some adjustments to our model and try again.
    In other words, the Test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypotheses generated by the learner, and it is the set of example held back from the learner. 
    
    Also, the Training set is distinct from the Test set.

# 4. What is the general principle of an ensemble method and what is bagging and boosting in ensemble method?
    The general principle of an ensemble method is to combine the predictions of several models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve robustness over a single model.  
    Bagging is a method in ensemble for improving unstable estimation or classification schemes.  
    While boosting method are used sequentially to reduce the bias of the combined model.  
    Boosting and Bagging both can reduce errors by reducing the variance term.

# 5. How can you avoid overfitting ?
    The problem of overefitting can be addressed by pruning a tree after it has learned in order to remove some of the detail it has picked up.
    Overfitting happens relatively as you have a small dataset and try to learn from it or that models the training data too well.
    If you have a small database and you are forced to come with a model based on that. In such situation, you can use a technique known as cross validation. 
    In Cross validation method the dataset splits into two section, testing and training datasets, the testing dataset will only test the model while, in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model.
    In this technique, a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. 
    The idea of cross validation is to define a dataset to “test” the model in the training phase.
